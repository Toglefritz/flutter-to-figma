/// Immutable state container for calculator operations and display.
///
/// This class represents the complete state of a calculator at any point in time,
/// including the current display value, stored operands, selected operation,
/// and input mode. The state is immutable to ensure predictable behavior
/// and support Flutter's reactive UI update mechanism.
///
/// State Lifecycle:
/// 1. Initial state: display="0", all other fields null/false
/// 2. Number input: display updates, isNewInput tracks input mode
/// 3. Operation selection: operand1 set, operation stored, isNewInput=true
/// 4. Second number input: display updates for second operand
/// 5. Calculation: result displayed, operands cleared, ready for next operation
///
/// Thread Safety: This class is immutable and therefore thread-safe.
/// All modifications create new instances via the [copyWith] method.
class CalculatorState {
  /// Creates a new calculator state with the specified values.
  ///
  /// All parameters are required to ensure complete state definition.
  /// Use [copyWith] for creating modified copies of existing states.
  ///
  /// @param display Current value shown in the calculator display
  /// @param operand1 First operand for binary operations (null if not set)
  /// @param operand2 Second operand for binary operations (null if not set)
  /// @param operation Selected operation symbol (null if no operation selected)
  /// @param isNewInput Whether the next digit input should start a new number

  /// This string represents what the user sees in the calculator display.
  /// It can be a number being entered, the result of a calculation, or
  /// an error message. The display is always a string to handle formatting,
  /// decimal points, and error states consistently.
  ///
  /// Examples: "0", "123.45", "Error", "âˆž"

  /// Null when the second operand hasn't been entered yet or after calculation.

  /// Currently selected mathematical operation.
  ///
  /// Represents the operation to be performed between [operand1] and [operand2].

  /// This flag controls input behavior:
  /// * true: Next digit starts a new number (replaces current display)
  /// * false: Next digit appends to current number (extends current display)
  ///
  /// Set to true after operations, calculations, or when starting fresh input.
  /// Set to false during continuous number entry.

  /// Creates a copy of this state with optionally updated values.
  ///
  /// This method implements the immutable update pattern by creating a new
  /// [CalculatorState] instance with the specified changes while preserving
  /// unchanged values from the current instance.
  ///
  /// This is the primary method for updating calculator state in response
  /// to user interactions. Each state change creates a new instance,
  /// ensuring predictable behavior and supporting Flutter's reactive updates.
  ///
  /// @param display New display value (preserves current if null)
  /// @param operand1 New first operand (preserves current if null)
  /// @param operand2 New second operand (preserves current if null)
  /// @param operation New operation (preserves current if null)
  /// @param isNewInput New input mode flag (preserves current if null)
  /// @returns New CalculatorState instance with updated values
  ///

  /// ```dart
  /// final newState = currentState.copyWith(
  ///   display: "123",
  ///   isNewInput: false,
