/// View layer for the calculator example UI presentation.
///
/// This StatelessWidget implements the view layer of the MVC pattern,
/// handling only UI presentation and user interaction forwarding.
/// All business logic and state management is delegated to the CalculatorController
/// passed as a constructor parameter.
///
/// Planned Layout Design:
/// * AppBar with title and theme-consistent styling
/// * Display area showing current number, operation, and results
/// * Grid layout with calculator buttons (numbers, operations, functions)
/// * Material Design theming with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
///
/// Planned User Experience:
/// * Large, readable display for numbers and results
/// * Intuitive button layout following calculator conventions
/// * Visual feedback for button presses and operations
/// * Error state handling with clear user messaging
///
/// Planned Accessibility Features:
/// * Semantic labels for screen readers
/// * High contrast colors for readability
/// * Proper touch targets for all interactive elements
/// * Keyboard navigation support for desktop platforms
///
/// Performance Considerations:
/// * Stateless widget for optimal rebuild performance
/// * Efficient grid layout for button organization
/// * Minimal widget tree depth for fast rendering
/// * Optimized text rendering for display updates
///
/// Implementation Status:
/// Currently shows placeholder text. Full calculator UI implementation
/// will be added in subsequent tasks as part of the development workflow.

  /// operands, and operations. It also provides methods for handling user interactions
  /// with calculator buttons. The view accesses state for display and calls
  /// controller methods in response to user actions.

  /// Builds the calculator screen UI with placeholder content.
  ///
  /// Currently displays a simple placeholder message indicating that the full
  /// calculator UI will be implemented in later tasks. The final implementation
  /// will include a display area and grid of calculator buttons.
  ///
  /// Planned Layout Structure:
  /// 1. AppBar with title and consistent theming
  /// 2. Display area showing current calculator state
  /// 3. Grid layout with calculator buttons:
  ///    - Number buttons (0-9)
  ///    - Operation buttons (+, -, *, /)
  ///    - Function buttons (=, C, .)
  ///    - Clear and backspace functionality
  ///
  /// Current Implementation:
  /// Shows placeholder text in centered layout with AppBar for navigation.
  /// This provides the basic screen structure while full functionality
  /// is developed in subsequent implementation tasks.
  ///
