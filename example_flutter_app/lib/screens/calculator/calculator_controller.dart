/// Controller for the calculator example business logic and state management.
///
/// This controller extends `State<CalculatorRoute>` and implements the
/// controller layer of the MVC pattern. It manages complex calculator state
/// through an immutable CalculatorState object and provides methods for
/// mathematical operations, number input, and state transitions.
///
/// State Management Strategy:
/// Uses an immutable state object pattern with copyWith() for predictable updates.
/// Each user interaction creates a new state instance, ensuring consistency and
/// supporting Flutter's reactive programming model with proper error handling.
///
/// Mathematical Operations:
/// * Basic arithmetic: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
/// * Decimal number support with proper formatting
/// * Error handling for edge cases (division by zero, overflow, invalid operations)
/// * Proper order of operations and chained calculations
///
/// Input Handling:
/// * Number input with multi-digit support and decimal points
/// * Operation selection with visual feedback and state transitions
/// * Clear functionality for resetting calculator state
/// * Input validation to prevent invalid state transitions
///
/// Thread Safety: All state modifications occur on the main UI thread through
/// setState(), ensuring thread-safe state management and UI consistency.
///
/// Performance: Immutable state objects and targeted setState() calls provide
/// optimal performance with predictable memory usage and garbage collection.

  /// This immutable state object represents the complete calculator state at any
  /// point in time. It includes the display value, stored operands, selected operation,
  /// and input mode flags. State updates create new instances through copyWith()
  /// to ensure predictable behavior and support Flutter's reactive updates.
  ///
  /// Initial State:
  /// * display: "0" (default display value)
  /// * operand1: null (no first operand stored)
  /// * operand2: null (no second operand stored)
  /// * operation: null (no operation selected)
  /// * isNewInput: true (ready for new number input)

  /// * Validation: Prevents invalid number formats and overflow

  ///
  /// Operation Behavior:
  /// * First operation: Stores current display as operand1, sets operation
  /// * Chained operations: Performs pending calculation, stores result, sets new operation
  /// * State transition: Prepares for second operand entry
  /// * Validation: Ensures valid operation sequences and prevents invalid states
  ///
  /// @param operation The mathematical operation symbol (+, -, *, /) that was pressed
  ///
  /// State Changes:
  /// * Sets or updates the selected operation
  /// * Stores current display value as operand1 (if not already set)

  /// * Sets isNewInput to true for next operand entry

  /// Calculation Behavior:
  /// * Performs operation between operand1 and operand2 (current display)
  /// * Updates display with calculation result
  /// * Handles mathematical errors (division by zero, overflow)
  /// * Prepares state for potential chained calculations
  /// * Maintains operation history for repeated equals presses
  ///
  /// Error Handling:
  /// * Division by zero: Displays "Error" message
  /// * Overflow: Displays "âˆž" or appropriate error indicator
  /// * Invalid state: Maintains current display without changes
  ///
  /// State Changes:
  /// * Updates display with calculation result or error message
  /// * Clears operand2 and operation after calculation
  /// * Sets isNewInput to true for fresh number entry
  /// * Preserves operand1 for potential chained operations

  ///
  /// This method resets all calculator state to the initial values, providing

  ///
  /// Clear Behavior:
  /// * Resets display to "0"
  /// * Clears all stored operands (operand1, operand2)
  /// * Removes selected operation
  /// * Sets input mode to accept new numbers
  /// * Provides immediate visual feedback through UI update
  ///

  /// * operand1: null (no stored operand)
  /// * operand2: null (no stored operand)
  /// * operation: null (no selected operation)
  /// * isNewInput: true (ready for new input)
  ///
  /// Use Cases:
  /// * Starting a new calculation after completing previous ones
  /// * Recovering from error states or invalid operations
  /// * Clearing accidental input before completing calculations

  ///
  /// Decimal Behavior:
  /// * New input: Starts with "0." for decimal numbers less than 1
  /// * Existing number: Appends decimal point if not already present
  /// * Validation: Prevents multiple decimal points in single number
  /// * Formatting: Maintains proper decimal number display format
  ///
  /// State Changes:
  /// * Updates display with decimal point added
  /// * Sets isNewInput to false for continued decimal entry
  /// * Maintains other state values unchanged
  ///
  /// Edge Cases:
  /// * Multiple decimal attempts: Ignores additional decimal points
  /// * Empty display: Starts with "0." format

  /// presentation including the grid layout, buttons, and display while the
  /// controller manages business logic and state.
  ///
  /// The build method is called by Flutter whenever the widget needs to be
  /// rendered or updated, typically in response to setState() calls or parent
  /// widget updates.
