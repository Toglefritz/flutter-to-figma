/// View layer for the color selector example UI presentation.
///
/// This StatelessWidget implements the view layer of the MVC pattern,
/// handling only UI presentation and user interaction forwarding.
/// All business logic and state management is delegated to the ColorSelectorController
/// passed as a constructor parameter.
///
/// Planned Layout Design:
/// * AppBar with title and theme-consistent styling
/// * Color preview area showing current color with large visual display
/// * RGB sliders section with individual red, green, blue controls
/// * HSL sliders section with hue, saturation, lightness controls
/// * Format display area showing hex, RGB, HSL, and CSS format strings
/// * Copy buttons for each format with clipboard integration
///
/// Planned User Experience:
/// * Real-time color updates as users move sliders
/// * Synchronized slider positions across RGB and HSL controls
/// * Large color preview for easy color evaluation
/// * One-tap copying of color values in multiple formats
/// * Visual feedback for all interactions and clipboard operations
///
/// Planned Accessibility Features:
/// * Semantic labels for all sliders and controls
/// * High contrast colors for readability
/// * Proper touch targets for all interactive elements
/// * Screen reader support for color values and format strings
/// * Keyboard navigation support for desktop platforms
///
/// Performance Considerations:
/// * Stateless widget for optimal rebuild performance
/// * Efficient slider widgets with smooth animations
/// * Minimal widget tree depth for fast rendering
/// * Optimized color calculations and format conversions
///
/// Implementation Status:
/// Currently shows placeholder text. Full color selector UI implementation
/// will be added in subsequent tasks as part of the development workflow.

  /// Currently displays a simple placeholder message indicating that the full
  /// color selector UI will be implemented in later tasks. The final implementation

  ///
  /// Planned Layout Structure:
  /// 1. AppBar with title and consistent theming
  /// 2. Color preview area with large color display
  /// 3. RGB controls section:
  ///    - Red slider (0-255) with value display
  ///    - Green slider (0-255) with value display
  ///    - Blue slider (0-255) with value display
  /// 4. HSL controls section:
  ///    - Hue slider (0-360Â°) with color wheel preview
  ///    - Saturation slider (0-100%) with gradient preview
  ///    - Lightness slider (0-100%) with brightness preview
  /// 5. Format display and copy section:
  ///    - Hex format with copy button
  ///    - RGB format with copy button
  ///    - HSL format with copy button
  ///    - CSS RGBA format with copy button
  ///
  /// Current Implementation:
  /// Shows placeholder text in centered layout with AppBar for navigation.
  /// This provides the basic screen structure while full functionality
  /// is developed in subsequent implementation tasks.
  ///

  /// @returns Scaffold widget containing the color selector screen UI
