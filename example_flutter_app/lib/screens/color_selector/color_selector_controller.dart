/// Controller for the color selector example business logic and state management.
///
/// This controller extends State&lt;ColorSelectorRoute&gt; and implements the controller layer
/// of the MVC pattern. It manages complex color state through an immutable ColorData
/// object and provides methods for color manipulation, format conversion, and
/// clipboard integration with real-time UI updates.
///
/// State Management Strategy:
/// Uses an immutable color data object with copyWith() for predictable updates.
/// Each color manipulation creates a new state instance with synchronized RGB and HSL
/// values, ensuring consistency across color spaces and supporting Flutter's reactive
/// programming model.
///
/// Color Operations:
/// * RGB manipulation: Individual red, green, blue component updates (0-255)
/// * HSL manipulation: Hue (0-360°), saturation (0-100%), lightness (0-100%) updates
/// * Format conversion: Automatic synchronization between RGB and HSL representations
/// * Clipboard integration: Copy color values in various formats (hex, RGB, HSL, CSS)
///
/// Real-time Updates:
/// * Immediate visual feedback for all color changes
/// * Synchronized slider updates across RGB and HSL controls
/// * Live color preview with updated display values
/// * Format string updates reflecting current color state
///
/// Thread Safety: All state modifications occur on the main UI thread through
/// setState(), ensuring thread-safe state management and UI consistency.
///
/// Performance: Immutable color objects and targeted setState() calls provide
/// optimal performance with efficient color calculations and minimal UI rebuilds.
