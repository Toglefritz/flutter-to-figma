# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Flutter â†’ Figma Plugin is a bridge between Flutter/Dart code and Figma design that automatically generates editable Figma designs from existing Flutter codebases. The plugin parses Flutter widget trees, extracts styling information from ThemeData, and translates layouts into Figma's native Auto Layout and variable systems. This creates a shared source of truth between developers and designers, enabling better synchronization and collaboration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload a Flutter/Dart file to the plugin, so that I can generate a corresponding Figma design automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a Dart file THEN the plugin SHALL accept and validate the file format
2. WHEN the file contains Flutter widgets THEN the plugin SHALL parse the widget structure successfully
3. IF the file is invalid or contains syntax errors THEN the plugin SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN the file is successfully uploaded THEN the plugin SHALL display a preview of detected widgets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the plugin to create Figma frames and components from Flutter widgets, so that I can work with design elements that match the actual implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Flutter widgets are parsed THEN the plugin SHALL create corresponding Figma nodes (frames, text, images)
2. WHEN a reusable Flutter widget is detected THEN the plugin SHALL create a Figma Component with variants
3. WHEN layout containers are found THEN the plugin SHALL apply Figma Auto Layout properties
4. WHEN widget hierarchies exist THEN the plugin SHALL maintain the correct parent-child relationships in Figma

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Flutter ThemeData to be converted to Figma Variables, so that styling remains consistent and tokenized across design and code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ThemeData is detected in the Flutter code THEN the plugin SHALL extract color, typography, and spacing values
2. WHEN theme values are extracted THEN the plugin SHALL create corresponding Figma Variables
3. WHEN multiple theme modes exist (light/dark) THEN the plugin SHALL create Figma Variable modes
4. WHEN widgets reference theme properties THEN the plugin SHALL apply the corresponding Figma Variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer, I want complex Flutter layouts to be accurately represented in Figma, so that the generated design matches the actual app appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Stack widgets are encountered THEN the plugin SHALL create positioned layouts in Figma
2. WHEN Positioned widgets are found THEN the plugin SHALL apply absolute positioning constraints
3. WHEN custom painted widgets are detected THEN the plugin SHALL provide fallback options (vector or raster import)
4. WHEN responsive layouts are present THEN the plugin SHALL create appropriate Auto Layout configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate designs for both individual widgets and complete screens, so that I can work at different levels of granularity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single widget file is provided THEN the plugin SHALL create a focused component design
2. WHEN a complete screen file is provided THEN the plugin SHALL create a full screen frame with all components
3. WHEN nested widgets are present THEN the plugin SHALL create appropriate component instances and overrides
4. WHEN the generated design is complete THEN the plugin SHALL organize elements in a logical Figma layer structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback during the conversion process, so that I can understand what's happening and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parsing process starts THEN the plugin SHALL display progress indicators
2. WHEN errors occur during parsing THEN the plugin SHALL provide specific error messages with line numbers
3. WHEN widgets cannot be converted THEN the plugin SHALL log warnings and suggest alternatives
4. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN the plugin SHALL provide a summary of created elements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the generated Figma elements to be fully editable, so that I can make design adjustments while maintaining the connection to code structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Figma elements are created THEN they SHALL be unlocked and editable
2. WHEN Variables are applied THEN they SHALL be properly linked and modifiable
3. WHEN Components are generated THEN they SHALL support variant creation and modification
4. WHEN Auto Layout is applied THEN it SHALL be configurable through Figma's native controls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the plugin to handle different Flutter widget types gracefully, so that complex applications can be converted successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common Flutter widgets (Container, Row, Column, Text) are encountered THEN the plugin SHALL convert them accurately
2. WHEN Material Design widgets are found THEN the plugin SHALL apply appropriate styling and behavior
3. WHEN Cupertino widgets are detected THEN the plugin SHALL handle iOS-specific design patterns
4. WHEN unsupported widgets are encountered THEN the plugin SHALL provide placeholder elements with clear labeling
