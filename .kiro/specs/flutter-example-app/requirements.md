# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Flutter example application that demonstrates various widget types and layout complexities. The app will serve as a test case for the Flutter-to-Figma plugin, showcasing how different Flutter UI patterns translate to Figma designs. The application will include three distinct examples: a simple counter app, a calculator with moderate complexity, and an advanced color selector with dynamic interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want a simple counter example app, so that I can test basic widget conversion from Flutter to Figma.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a counter screen as the default home page
2. WHEN the user taps the increment button THEN the system SHALL increase the counter value by 1
3. WHEN the counter value changes THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
4. IF the counter reaches large numbers THEN the system SHALL display them without overflow
5. WHEN the user views the counter screen THEN the system SHALL show a floating action button, centered text display, and app bar

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want a calculator example with moderate layout complexity, so that I can test grid-based layouts and button interactions in Figma conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the calculator THEN the system SHALL display a grid of number and operation buttons
2. WHEN the user taps number buttons THEN the system SHALL append digits to the current input display
3. WHEN the user taps operation buttons (+, -, *, /) THEN the system SHALL store the operation for calculation
4. WHEN the user taps equals THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the result
5. WHEN the user taps clear THEN the system SHALL reset the calculator to initial state
6. IF invalid operations are performed THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
7. WHEN the calculator displays results THEN the system SHALL format numbers appropriately for readability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want an advanced color selector example, so that I can test complex interactive widgets and dynamic styling in Figma conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the color selector THEN the system SHALL display RGB, HSL, and hex input controls
2. WHEN the user adjusts any color value THEN the system SHALL update the background color in real-time
3. WHEN the user selects a color THEN the system SHALL display the color in multiple formats (hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL)
4. WHEN the user taps a color format THEN the system SHALL copy that format to the clipboard
5. WHEN colors are copied THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation message
6. WHEN the background color changes THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable with appropriate contrast
7. IF color values are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide validation feedback
8. WHEN the user interacts with sliders THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, responsive color transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want navigation between different examples, so that I can test multiple screen layouts and navigation patterns in Figma conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL provide a main navigation screen or drawer
2. WHEN the user selects an example THEN the system SHALL navigate to that specific screen
3. WHEN the user is on any example screen THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to navigation
4. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain proper Flutter navigation stack
5. IF the user uses device back button THEN the system SHALL handle navigation appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the app to follow Flutter best practices, so that the generated Figma designs represent well-structured Flutter code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any screen THEN the system SHALL follow MVC architecture pattern with separate route, controller, and view files
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use setState() as the primary state management approach
3. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL extract them into separate widget classes
4. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL implement proper validation and error handling
5. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing with Padding widgets rather than SizedBox
6. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow the established file naming and directory structure conventions
